# NowPlayer
A simple 'Now Playing' hovering window in MacOS app.

Your desiered audio source must be connected through that service's API.

The code should look something like this:

// Add a function to execute AppleScript or interact with your chosen music player API
    private func executeAppleScript(_ script: String) {
        // Implement the code to execute AppleScript here
        // You can use the 'NSAppleScript' class to run AppleScript commands.
